Task 01 â€“ Linear Regression for House Price Prediction

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage, and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Using the House Price Dataset
, the model is trained to understand how these features influence house prices. This task demonstrates the use of supervised learning in real estate valuation and provides insight into how linear models can be applied for predictive analytics.
